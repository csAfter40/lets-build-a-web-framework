I've been learning about Django for a while and came up with Jacob Kaplan Moss's(Django co creator) "Let's build a web framework!" course on PyCon 2017. I decided to go through this course and learn more about how things work under the hood.

In this project I've experienced:
    - Creating and running a wsgi server in development environment.
    - Converting incoming requests into python objects.
    - Routing requests to applications(functions in this case).
    - Setting up an ORM with Sqlalchemy.
    - Using Jinja for template rendering.
